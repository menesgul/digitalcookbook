# TasteBook

TasteBook is an online recipe-book platform where users can explore, search, and browse recipes by category.
The project also enables admins to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to efficiently manage and curate recipe content. 
Additionally, it features user and admin authentication, a fully responsive design, and API integration. 

This project provided an excellent opportunity to enhance my skills in backend development using PHP, 
database management with MySQL, and creating dynamic and responsive web interfaces.
Through building TasteBook, I gained valuable experience in implementing authentication systems,
managing CRUD operations, and ensuring seamless user interaction across devices.
